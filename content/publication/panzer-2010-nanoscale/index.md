abstract: "The degree of interpenetration at the interface between colloidal quantum dots (QDs) and organic semiconductor molecules commonly employed in hybrid light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) has been examined using tapping-mode atomic force microscopy. Both phase separation-driven and Contact Printing-enabled QD/semiconductor heterojunction fabrication methodologies lead to significant QD embedment in the underlying organic film with the greatest degree of QD penetration observed for QD monolayers that have been contact printed. The relative performance of QD-LEDs fabricated via three different methods using the same materials set has also been investigated."
