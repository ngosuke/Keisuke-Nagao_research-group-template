abstract: "What if expression of a light-sensitive protein could be triggered wirelessly, on demand? What if optogenetics and neuropharmacology could be implemented in an untethered, freely moving animal model? Such technology would allow for a plethora of neurobiological experiments that are currently confounded by repeated animal handling, tissue-damaging cannulas, and tangled optical cables. In the July 30 issue of Cell, Jeong and colleagues introduce such a technology. The ultrathin and flexible devices, termed wireless optofluidic probes, enable remote control of drug infusion and optical manipulation in the deep-brain regions of freely moving mice engaged in behavioral tasks (Jeong et al., 2015) (Figure 1)."
