abstract: "Improvements in quantum dot light-emitting device (QD-LED) performance are achieved by the choice of organic charge transporting layers, by use of different colloidal QDs for the different parts of the visible spectrum, and by utilizing a recently demonstrated robust QD deposition method. Spectrally narrow electroluminescence of our QD-LEDs is tuned over the entire visible wavelength range from λ = 460 nm (blue) to λ = 650 nm (deep red). By printing close-packed monolayers of different QD types inside an identical QD-LED structure, we demonstrate that different color QD-LEDs with QDs of different chemistry can be fabricated on the same substrate. We discuss mechanisms responsible for efficiency increase for green (4-fold) and orange (30%) QD-LEDs as compared to previous reports and outline challenges associated with achieving high-efficiency blue QD-LEDs."
