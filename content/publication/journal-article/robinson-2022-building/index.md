abstract: "Scientists around the globe are joining the race to achieve engineering feats to read, write, modulate, and interface with the human brain in a broadening continuum of invasive to non-invasive ways. The expansive implications of neurotechnology for our conception of health, mind, decision-making, and behavior has raised social and ethical considerations that are inextricable from neurotechnological progress. We propose 'socio-technical' challenges as a framing to integrate neuroethics into the engineering process. Intentionally aligning societal and engineering goals within this framework offers a way to maximize the positive impact of next-generation neurotechnologies on society."
