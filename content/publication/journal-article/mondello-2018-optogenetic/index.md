abstract: "Electrical intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) at various sites along the cervical spinal cord permits forelimb muscle activation, elicits complex limb movements and may enhance functional recovery after spinal cord injury. Here, we explore optogenetic spinal stimulation (OSS) as a less invasive and cell type-specific alternative to ISMS. To map forelimb muscle activation by OSS in rats, adeno-associated viruses (AAV) carrying the blue-light sensitive ion channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and Chronos were injected into the cervical spinal cord at different depths and volumes. Following an AAV incubation period of several weeks, OSS-induced forelimb muscle activation and movements were assessed at 16 sites along the dorsal surface of the cervical spinal cord. Three distinct movement types were observed. We find that AAV injection volume and depth can be titrated to achieve OSS-based activation of several movements. Optical stimulation of the spinal cord is thus a promising method for dissecting the function of spinal circuitry and targeting therapies following injury."
