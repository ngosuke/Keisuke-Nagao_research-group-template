abstract: "We demonstrate exciton energy transfer from a thin film of phosphorescent dye fac tris(2-phenylpyridine) iridium (Ir(ppy)3) to a monolayer of colloidal CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs). The energy transfer is manifested in time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements as elongation of the QD PL time constant from 40 to 400 ns, and a concomitant 55% increase of time-integrated QD PL intensity. The observed PL dynamics are shown to be dominated by exciton diffusion within the Ir(ppy)3 film to the QD layer."
