	abstract = {Fiber drawing enables scalable fabrication of multifunctional flexible fibers that integrate electrical, optical and microfluidic modalities to record and modulate neural activity. Constraints on thermomechanical properties of materials, however, have prevented integrated drawing of metal electrodes with low-loss polymer waveguides for concurrent electrical recording and optical neuromodulation. Here we introduce two fabrication approaches: (1) an iterative thermal drawing with a soft, low melting temperature (Tm) metal indium, and (2) a metal convergence drawing with traditionally non-drawable high Tm metal tungsten. Both approaches deliver multifunctional flexible neural interfaces with low-impedance metallic electrodes and low-loss waveguides, capable of recording optically-evoked and spontaneous neural activity in mice over several weeks. We couple these fibers with a light-weight mechanical microdrive (1g) that enables depth-specific interrogation of neural circuits in mice following chronic implantation. Finally, we demonstrate the compatibility of these fibers with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and apply them to visualize the delivery of chemical payloads through the integrated channels in real time. Together, these advances expand the domains of application of the fiber-based neural probes in neuroscience and neuroengineering.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
