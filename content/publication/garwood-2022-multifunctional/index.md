abstract: "Recording and modulating neural activity in vivo enables investigations of neural circuits during behavior. However, there is a dearth of tools for simultaneous recording and localized receptor modulation in large animal models. We address this limitation by translating multifunctional fiber-based neurotechnology previously only available for rodent studies to enable cortical and subcortical neural modulation in macaques. We record single unit and local field potential activity before, during, and after intracranial GABA infusions in the premotor cortex and putamen. We apply state-space models to characterize changes in neural activity and investigate how neural activity evoked by a working memory task varies in the presence of local inhibition. The recordings provide detailed insight into the electrophysiological effect of neurotransmitter receptor modulation in both cortical and subcortical structures in an awake, behaving macaque. Our results demonstrate a first-time translation of multifunctional fibers for causal studies in behaving non-human primates."
